              Automation control panels are electrical panels that house various components and devices used to control industrial processes, machinery, or entire systems. They allow automation of operations, reducing the need for manual intervention and improving the efficiency of operations.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-6">
              These panels typically include a combination of programmable logic controllers (PLCs), sensors, safety devices, input/output systems, and various relays or contactors that work together to control machinery or systems based on real-time data and programmed instructions.

            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Input Acquisition:</span> The system receives data from various sensors (temperature, pressure, level, etc.) that measure the current state of the process.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Processing:</span> The data is sent to the PLC, which processes the input data according to pre-programmed instructions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Decision Making:</span> Based on the processed data, the PLC makes decisions (e.g., turn on a motor, adjust speed, open a valve) to control the process or machinery.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Output Control:</span> The PLC sends control signals to actuators, motors, or valves via the I/O modules. The components then carry out the actions necessary to maintain or adjust the process.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Monitoring and Feedback:</span> The operator uses the HMI to monitor real-time data and system performance, adjust settings, or receive alerts on system faults or required actions.
